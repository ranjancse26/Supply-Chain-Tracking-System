# Supply-Chain-Tracking-System
This implementation is powered by Ethereum Blockchain and is distributed, immutable and audit-able. 

Organisations that are a part of this supply chain blockchain system can register themselves as Supply Chain product handlers. 

This implementation prevents counterfeit product from getting into a supply chain and being represent the exact product or a unit. So, a counterfeit manufacturer wonâ€™t be able fake their products as at the brand ones. 

This solution can be used with IoT sensors, QR codes, etc to identify sensors/QR codes of the product packaging that identifies the exact unit of the product, and audit all the life of the product. 

More third party product handlers (like governments, regulatory bodies, etc) can be brought in to empower a more transparent and fair global economic system.

Another aspect of the product supply chain tracking using Ethereum based smart contracts is to bring not just tracking details but product stories to the table as well. With such implementations, 

someone who is sourcing electronics part from China could very well be aware of how it was manufactured? 
Was the labor behind this overworked? 
Did it follow through all QA procedures? 
How the raw material to manufacture this piece of electronic equipment was sourced? 
Was it processed the way it should be during the manufacturing process?
